We are going to write testcase using javascript framework like mocha, nyc, chai and jest.
Mocha: Its a javascript test framework which we will install using npm 
Nyc: Its a javascript test framework which give the result in a proper readble framework.
Chai: Chai provides some functionality which mocha and jest doesn't provide.
Jest: Jest is again a javascript test framework which is a combination of mocha, assert and nyc. 
At last we will be replacing mocha and nyc with jest.

Just add jest instead instead of mocha, remaining functionality will be same. We need to update only the library
as jest contains all mocha and chai features.

So here we just need to learn jest instead of mocha and chai. Because jest will contains all the feature of 
chai and mocha.
